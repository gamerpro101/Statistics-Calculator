This is my statistics calculator made by myself. I did not use ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot in any way while making this. I first made this as a private project for my teachers at school to impress them, but I later decided I might make it public too. This is made using C#, the programming language I know the most and have been programming with for the longest time. This is solely a Windows application. I might remake it in GTK if I have time.
